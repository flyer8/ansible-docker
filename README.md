##Deploying Docker cluster with Ansible

The cluster consists of:
* Load balancer HAProxy
* 2 nodes Web server Django/Python 1.10.3
* 2 nodes (master/slave) PostgreSQL 5.3 database

The deployment was performed on local VM Linux Ubuntu 16.04 with Ansible v. 2.2.0.0 and Docker v. 1.12.1 installed. 

1: First you need to make sure that the SSH keys were created for current user (root) with the appropriate permissions.

2: In inventory file ```/etc/ansible/hosts``` was added:
```
[local]
localhost
```
3: Clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/flyer8/loyalty-ans.git /opt/loyalty-ans
```
The directory contains scripts of the Web application Django in ```code/```, Dockerfile-files for building appropriate images and Ansible playbook ```site.yml``` for deploying the cluster. File ```docker-compose.yml``` is not used as it was needed for testing with Docker-compose tool.
